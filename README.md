# Daily-Coding-Challenge
Just me uploading solutions to Daily Coding Challenges whenever I get time. 
The Challenges is spilt by Days so that I can try solving with Mutiple Languages in order to learn their syntax. 
If the challenge has a follow through/bonus question that upps the difficulty of the problem, I will be solving only that, unless the original one gives me a hard time too. 
Each day will have the relevant problem details in the problem.txt.
